### Description of the data

#### Raw data
* As descriped in the readme.md, read the README.txt from the UCI HAR Dataset.
* The raw data is actually hard to understand. There are a few txt-documents that contains different parts of the dataset. 
* "train/X_train.txt" (Measurements traingroup) and "test/X_test.txt" (Measurements Testgroup) overall contains measurements for 561 variables from over 9000 observations. 
* "train/subject_train.txt" and "test/subject_test.txt"
