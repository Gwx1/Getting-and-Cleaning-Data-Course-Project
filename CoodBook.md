### Description of the data

##### UCI HAR Dataset  [1] (Raw data)
* As descriped in the readme.md, read the README.txt from the UCI HAR Dataset.
* The raw data is actually hard to understand. There are a few txt-documents that contains different parts of the dataset. 
* "train/X_train.txt" (Measurements traingroup) and "test/X_test.txt" (Measurements Testgroup) overall contains measurements for 561 variables from over 9000 (!) observations. All observations are clearly attributable to the examined 30 people. 70% of the examined persons are located in the X_train-data and 30% in the X_test-data.
* "train/subject_train.txt" and "test/subject_test.txt" contains the ID's of the examined persons for the Train- and Testdata.
* "train/y_train.txt" and "train/y_train.txt" contains the activity done by each subject
* "activity_labels.txt" shows the assignment from the number of each activity to the empirical value
* "features.txt" contains all column-names for the X_train and X_test-data.
* For the purpose of this Course-Project the documents in the "Inertial Signals" can be ignored
* The order of the different parts matches each other

##### Tidydata.txt (Tidy data)

* The Tidydata.txt is the summary of the avarage value of each variable with the keywords "mean" and "std" for each activity and each subject. Since there are multiple measurements of each subject (maybe different time points) in the raw data, the tidydata forms for each subject and each from the six activitys the avarage value. 
* In addition the dataset merges the training and the test-sets (X_Train and X_test) to create one data set.
* It also assign the ID's of the examined persons and the performed activity to each subject and name the columns. 

### Performed Transformations
* columnbind labels to the values of the Testsubjects
* columnbind labels to the values of the Trainsubjects
* rowbind the ID's (subject_test and subject_train)
* rowbind the labels and values of the Testsubjects with the labels and values of the Trainsubjects
* columnbind the ID's with the rowbinded labels and values of testsubjects and trainsubjects to create one dataset
* rename the colnames of the previous dataset to "ID" (subject-number), "Act" (Activity) and the names from the "features.txt"-file 
* extract only the variables/columnnames "ID", "Act" and variables with the keywords "mean()" and "std()" and form a new dataset
* revalue the activity-values (1,2,...) to the empirical values (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS,...)
* Summarise each variable with the mean grouped by "ID" and "Act"
* rename the colnames of the aggregated variables (Avarage_{Old_Var}
